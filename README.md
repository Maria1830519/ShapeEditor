This is a simple application for shape creation and edition written in C# and using Visual Studio Windows Forms. 
The program allows the user to create 4 different shapes: Square, Triangle, Ellipse and Regular Polygon.
After this, the program offers the user the following tools to edit the shapes:
-Translation or moving: Change the place where the shape is drawn without altering its position or size
-Rotation: Rotates the shape from its centre point, maintaining its size.
-Scaling or resize: Changes the size of the shape but keeps its shape
-Mirroring or reflecting: Reflects the shape keeping its size, as if it was being reflected on a mirror. Unfortunately, it does not work for all shapes.
-Delete: Deletes the shape from the form
