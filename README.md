This is a basic application for shape creation and 
edition written with C# and using Visual Studio Windows Forms. This program allows the user 
to create 4 different shapes: Square, Triangle, Ellipse and Regular Polygon. After this, the 
program offers the user the tools to edit the shapes created or delete them. The possible 
editions available are:
• Translation or moving: Changes the place where the shape is drawn without altering
its position or size.
• Rotation: Rotates the shape from its centre point, maintaining its size.
• Scaling or resize: Changes the size of the shape but keeps its shape.
• Mirroring or reflecting: Reflect the shape keeping its size, as if it was being reflected on 
a mirror.
• Delete: Deletes the shape from the form.
